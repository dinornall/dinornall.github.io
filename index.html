							<h2>Mechanical Engineering Research Assistant</h2>
							<p>For a research collaboration with the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL), I am designing a hydrofoil model in Onshape to suspend a hydrofoil in a wave-current tank.
								We are looking to examine the effect heave and pitch have on the force generation of the foil. As of now the model is the main focus of the project, but
								starting next semester my tasks will entail calibrating flow, testing the foil at varying conditions, and analyzing data using MATLAB.</p>

							<h2>Ultralight Multifunctional Bike Wrench</h2>

								refining the design to achieve target strength-to-weight ratios. The fabrication 
								of the wrench involved milling, drilling, and finishing 
								aluminum stock to manufacture the wrench. The wrench wass able to survive functional tests that verify 
								the wrench's ability to tighten bolts to specified torque values without failure. We then had to create
								a write-up detailing our thought process during the design, analysis, and manufacturing of the wrench.</p>

								Arduino Uno microcontroller for movement and maneuvering

								implement collision-avoidance algorithms, enabling the car to
								avoid obstacles. The car was programmed to move forward when there
								nothing was directly in front of it, and turn when something was.
								This allowed the car to (for the most part) avoid obstacles that 
								were in its way. </p>

							<h2>Plywood Box Layout Simulation</h2>
							<p>This project involves a MATLAB-based Monte Carlo simulation to calculate 
								the efficiency of cutting plywood sheets into boxes of varying sizes. 
								The program uses a randomized algorithm to place box parts (sides, top, 
								bottom) on the plywood sheet, considering the saw kerf. By running the simulation 
								1000 times for each box length and analyzing the maximum number of complete 
								boxes and the resulting waste, the project allows a very good estimate of the 
								relationship between box dimensions and material utilization. Results 
								are presented as plots of maximum box yield and waste area versus box 
								length in two separate graphs.</p>
