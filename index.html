I am responsible for overseeing the mechanical design and development of the robot, ensuring all components are well-integrated and function as intended. This role involves coordinating with the electrical and computer subteams, as well as managing timelines and fostering communication within my own team. We are using Onshape to collaboratively design the robot, allowing every member to simultaneously and efficiently contribute to the CAD model. I have applied valuable lessons from last year's humanoid project to this new challenge, focusing on effective teamwork, providing a learning experience for all members, and ensuring no single person is overburdened. Thus far, our robot dog has gone through several design iterations to reach its current state. These iterations addressed various challenges, including clearance issues, general design improvements, and a mini weight crisis where I discovered—after performing hand calculations and assembling the full CAD model—that our initial design was likely too heavy and large. We also performed FEA to ensure the body was structurally sound. It has been an incredible experience leading the mechanical subteam through the design and prototyping phases, and next semester we plan to focus on assembly, testing, and the core robotics research aspects of the project.",

While we were not able to complete the project before the end of the semester, I was able to gain incredibly valuable experience in collaborative engineering, CAD design, and robotics in general. Towards the end of the project, I even spent lots of time in the makerspace working on 3D printing and machining parts for the humanoid. An important lesson I learned from this project is the importance of weight in robotic systems. Our design ended up being too heavy and bulky for the motors we had selected, limiting the humanoid's motion. I look forward to applying this lesson (along with others) in future robotics projects!",
